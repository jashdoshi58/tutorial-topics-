<p><i>Javascript!!!!!</i></p>

<p><i>Visual Boy Studio Code App</i></p>
<ul>
    <li>Remember that I said that P5.js editor app is "ONE OF THE BEST" yeah because Visual Studio Code Is the best app if not one of the best app to code and make games . this app just has auto correction that helps you out a ton while also be a little bit annoying as it just auto-corrects . It is also having the background option for your own cofortability and also it is really hard to pas on when you are coding . So definetly check Visual studio Code App and download it right away if you interested in coding etc. </li>
